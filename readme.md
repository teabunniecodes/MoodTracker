1. Python 3 (> 3.7 prefered)
2. PIP

installed.

# Installation
Before running the app, you'll need first to install the dependencies:

# How to
1. If you want to run the **CLI** app, then:
    1. First you need to create the database and its tables, so you'll need to migrate:

        `python migrate.py`
    2. Then run the app as you preferred, whether the GUI or the CLI:

        `python cli.py`
2. If you want to run the **GUI** app, then just simply run it:

    `python gui.py`
